### Hello there, I'm Luna 👋
- 🔭 I'm a full-time college student in my second year with an active interest in gymnastics, digital illustration, and video games
- 🌱 I'm currently working through [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and trying to learn the front-end fundamentals (just hosted my first react app!)
- 🎧 I'm currently obssessed with [tainy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK7eHoocQlE) && [joji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EA9Fd6fqyI)

Thanks for dropping by ❤️
