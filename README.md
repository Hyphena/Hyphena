- 🎓 i'm in my second year of community college studying for my associates in science
- 🌱 i'm slowly working through the [rust book](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&si=PJkahmRPFla8veoK) and struggling to piece together how [rojo](https://rojo.space/) and roblox as a whole works
- 🎧 i'm currently obsessed with [100 gecs](https://youtu.be/M6MV1nxxGf8) (their [noise resonates](https://youtu.be/vaBFLNWnQ0E) with me somehow, i can't explain it)
