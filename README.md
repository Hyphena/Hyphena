### Hello there, I'm Luna 👋
- 🔭 I'm a full-time college student in my second year with an active interest in gymnastics, digital illustration, and video games
- 🌱 I'm currently working through [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and trying to improve my understandings of the front-end fundamentals, don't expect too much activity for a good bit
- 🎧 I'm currently obssessed with [Disco Elysium's soundtrack](https://youtu.be/Kkjmos0tjbc) && [kessoku band](https://youtu.be/gX9m-rCtSqc)

Thank you for stopping by ❤️
